                        <h3>KOALA</h3> 
                        <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear[a] (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native 
                           to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives 
                           are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's 
                           eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.  It is easily 
                           recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala 
                           has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. 
                           Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.</p>
                             <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because 
                                this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours 
                                a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate 
                                with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands 
                                located on their chests.</p>
                           
                           <p>Koalas are herbivorous creatures that are found in open forests and woodlands as 
                              well as areas with tropical and cool temperature climates.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong> 
                           
                            <p>You will find the koalas at pen K91, in the lost forest.</p>
