                        <h3>GORILLAS</h3> 
                        <p>Gorillas are predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
                           The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. 
                           The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living 
                           relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 
                           metres, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in 
                           troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker 
                           fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>
                        <p>The closest relatives of gorillas are the other two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having 
                           diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the 
                           sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has.[9] Until recently, 
                           gorillas were considered to be a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern 
                           lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla.</p>
                           
                           <p>Gorillas are herbivorous animals and they dwell in the tropical, dense or subtropical forests, 
                              lowland swamps, marshes and even in cloud forests nearby volcanic areas.

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong> 
                           
                            <p>You will find the gorillas at pen G15, in designated areas around the monkey trail.</p>
