                        <h3>LOST FOREST</h3> 
                        <p>The Lost Forest is a section of the zoo that contains a large variety of wild 
                           animals, mostly herbivores that are seperately allocated throughout the forest 
                           as to avoid accidents and interactions between the other animals. Here, the giraffes, 
                           koalas, monkeys and other herbivorous animals are going to be situated here.</p>
                         
                          <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                          <p>The lost forest will be on the left side of the zoo's entrance, next to the amphitheatre.</p>
