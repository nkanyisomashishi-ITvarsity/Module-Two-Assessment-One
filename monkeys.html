                        <h3>MONKEYS</h3> 
                        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also 
                           known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, 
                           a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making 
                           the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are 
                           species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally 
                           considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys. Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates 
                           (suborder Strepsirrhini). The simians' sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.</p> 
                           <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just 
                              over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight,[33] to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).[34] Some are 
                              arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, 
                              seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders)</p>
                           
                           <p>Monkeys, or simians are herbivorous and sometimes, omnivorous and they dwell within forests and jungles, 
                              mostly in trees and they are also nomadic.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong> 
                           
                            <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M6, alongside the lost forest.</p>
