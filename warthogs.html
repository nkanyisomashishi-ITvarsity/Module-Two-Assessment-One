                        <h3>WARTHOGS</h3> 
                        <p>Warthogs are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were 
                           formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the 
                           best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus. 
                           Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, 
                           and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in 
                           males. They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres) in the males, but are always smaller in the females.</p> 
                        <p>They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animals.[3] While both species remain fairly common and widespread, and therefore 
                           are considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, commonly known 
                           as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.</p>
                           
                           <p>Warthogs are herbivorous and are normally situated in savannahs, 
                              deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water and travel in large packs.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong> 
                           
                            <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W16, 60 ft away from Mo's Pizza.</p>
