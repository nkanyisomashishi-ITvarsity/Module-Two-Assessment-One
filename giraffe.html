                        <h3>GIRAFFES</h3> 
                        <p>The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
                            However, the existence of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other prehistoric species, known from fossils, are extinct.
                            The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. 
                            Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, 
                            which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
                            as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>
                            <p>All giraffes have thick and elongated necks, including a long tongue, used to pull down tree branches and for eating 
                              tree leaves and to observe their surroundings for incoming predators as well, due to their magnificent height, while they have much smaller 
                              bodies. They also have short horns. The males have knobbed horns with a bald tip, whereas female horns are thin with tufts 
                              of hair growing at the tips. Giraffes also have white or cream coats or fur with orange, chesnut, nearly black or brown blotches (spots). A giraffe's
                              neck is 2.4 metres (7.9 feet) long that is used for reaching leaves in tall trees and branches.</p>
                           
                           <p>Giraffes are herbivorous animals and mainly stay in wildlife forests
                              most of the time.</p> 

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong> 
                           
                            <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G32, across the elephants.</p>
